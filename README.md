# Structured CV: My Career in Code

This Python package was developed as a way to showcase my professional and technical skills through a structured, object-oriented framework. 
The idea behind this project is to "show, not tell" â€” rather than simply describing my experience, I have built a tool that models my CV as a collection of Python objects, demonstrating my ability to design and implement such solutions.

Although initially created to represent my own background, the package has been designed with flexibility in mind. 
The classes are generic enough that they can be easily adapted by others to model their own professional profiles. 

The package provides an efficient way to structure and organize key aspects of a CV, including education, work experience, projects, and publications, and allows for conversion between multiple formats such as CSV, HTML/Markdown, and JSON. 

Additionally, the CV can be visualized through data visualizations. 

## Getting Started

2. Clone this repository and cd into the repository
3. run: ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt```

[//]: <> or you can install the package directly using: ```bash pip install git+https://github.com/rushkock/rushkock``` 

### See my CV
To see my full CV in your command line you can run: 
```bash 
python3 ruchellas_cv.py
```

### Example Usage
### Python 
```python
from cv_objects import Course,Project,Skills
courses = [Course('Applied Cognitive Psychology'), Course('Cognitive Neuroscience'), Course('Clinical Neuropsychology'), Course('Artificial Intelligence'),Course('Minor in Programming')]

thesis_bsc = Project(start_date=date(2019, 3, 1),
                 end_date=date(2019, 7, 1),
                 company="Leiden University",
                 skills=[Skills("Statistics", 1), Skills("Permutation Testing",1), Skills('Simulations',1)],
                 project_title="Violation of homogeneity of variances: A comparison between Welchâ€™s t-test and the permutation test",
